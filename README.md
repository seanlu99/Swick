Swick brings simplicity and efficiency to the dining experience. 
It serves as an alternative to traditional menus and expensive tablet systems.
By scanning a QR code at a table, the customer can browse the menu, order, make requests, and pay straight from the app.
Servers receive orders on their app and are able to manage order statuses and fulfil customer requests.
Restaurant owners can login to their dashboard to update their menu, view orders and finances, manage servers and edit their information displayed on the apps.
