# Swick
Swick brings simplicity and efficiency to the dining experience. 
It serves as an alternative to traditional menus and expensive tablet systems.
By scanning a QR code at a table, the customer can browse the menu, order, and pay straight from the app.
Servers receive orders on their app, and have views of orders to cook and to send.
Restaurant owners can login to their dashboard to edit restaurant information, update their menu and view orders.
